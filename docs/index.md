# **Nextflow Tutorial with Freyja**

Welcome to **Nextflow Training Tutorial with Freyja**! 

This tutorial is designed to teach you [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/overview.html) by using examples with [Freyja](https://andersen-lab.github.io/Freyja/index.html#), a tool for analyzing SARS-CoV-2 wastewater sequencing data.

## What You'll Learn
- **Introduction to Nextflow** – Basics, syntax, and workflow concepts
- **Understanding Freyja** – What it does and how it works
- **Building a Nextflow pipeline** to process sequencing data using Freyja
- **Running and optimizing Nextflow workflows**

## Tutorial Outline

### **Introduction to Nextflow**
- What is Nextflow?
- Why use Nextflow for bioinformatics?
- Basic concepts: processes, channels, and DAGs
- Installation and setup

### **Introduction to Freyja**
- Overview of Freyja and its purpose
- How it processes sequencing data
- Expected inputs and outputs
- Example command-line usage

### **Building a Nextflow Pipeline with Freyja**
